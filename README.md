# Workout-tracker-app

## Description
The Workout Tracker App allows users to view, add, and track their daily workouts. The application is great for those who want to log workouts, and see summary statistics for multiple days at a time.

## Installation
1. Go to the website: https://workout-tracker-app-26.herokuapp.com/?id=5f93934264daed0017d6deaa
2. To create a new workout, click the green "New Workout Button"
3. After that's selected, you'll have to select an exercise type: either cardio or resistance.
4. Based on what you select, fill out the required fields and when you're finished you either select the green "Add Exercise Button" or the blue "Complete" button.
5. That should then bring you back to the home page, and you'll see the Date, Total Workout Duration, and The Number of Exercises performed.
6. By Clicking "Dashboard" in the top right corner next to "Fitness Tracker", you'll see the workout dashboard which displays charts about the workouts performed during the past week.
